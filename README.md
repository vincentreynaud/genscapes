# Genscapes

Genscapes is an application designed to let users generate drone music in the browser and share their compositions via url. To date, it is still at an unfinished MVP stage.

The app allows a set of tracks to play in parallel, each with their own signal chain that the user can edit. A set of parameters are made easily accessible to shape each sounds.
