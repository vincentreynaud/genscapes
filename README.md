# Genscapes

Genscapes is an application MVP designed to let users generate drone music in the browser and share their compositions via url. To date, it is still at an unfinished state, but the exercise of writing a dynamic application with Tone.js and the Web Audio API was exciting.

The app allows a set of tracks to play in parallel, each with their own signal chain that the user can edit. A set of parameters are made easily accessible to shape each sounds.
