# @elemaudio/core-lite

> Elementary Audio (Lite version) signal processing library

Elementary is a JavaScript framework for writing functional, declarative audio applications with a high
performance, native audio engine. Elementary aims to lower the barrier to entry into the
audio application space, eliminate the gap between prototyping and production, and bring the functional reactive
programming model to DSP.
